 Password Generator Project -
I am excited to share a project I developed during my internship at hashtag#Codsoft, where I had the opportunity to enhance my Python and GUI development skills.
ðŸ”‘ Project Overview:
This is a Password Generator tool built using Pythonâ€™s tkinter library. The application allows users to generate strong, medium, or weak passwords based on their preferences. It offers the following features:
Customizable Password Length: Users can select the length of their password (from 5 to 18 characters).
Strength Options: Three levels of password strength are provided (weak, medium, and strong).
Weak: Lowercase letters only.
Medium: Lowercase + uppercase letters.
Strong: Lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.
Clipboard Copy: The generated password can easily be copied to the clipboard with a single click.
The tool makes use of Pythonâ€™s random module to generate a password from a pool of characters based on the selected strength. The tkinter library provides a user-friendly graphical interface for the application.

Tkinter (GUI)
